# 👋 Welcome
Welcome to the **Cloud API** of Bosch eBike Systems. We provide several APIs. Just explore the different categories and pick and integrate those APIs into your application, which are necessary for your use cases.

- **Cloud API for eBike Flow app** provides riders read-only access to their data like eBike profile and activity records, collected via the eBike Flow app and enables OEMs to upload bike model information to be served by the eBike Flow app
- **Cloud API for ConnectModule** empowers partners to claim ownership of and manage Bosch ConnectModule (BCM) configurations and to subscribe to BCM events in order to receive notifications.
- **Cloud API for eBike product data** enables OEMs to exchange supply chain data with Bosch to gain insights into market dynamics.

## Draft vs production APIs
The Cloud API reference documentation lists APIs in status _draft_ or _production_.
### Draft APIs
Draft APIs are early versions of APIs, which are not stable and cannot be used for production purposes. The API version is the date of the last change. Draft APIs are using the suffix `(Draft)` in the API name. The intention of publishing draft APIs is to involve you already in an early stage during design and development of new APIs. So please don't hesitate to send us your feedback.
### Production APIs
There are stable APIs, which can be used for your production purposes. The API version follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Production APIs don't use a suffix in the API name.
